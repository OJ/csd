########### Webmachine Configuration ###################

# here is the first of the front-end sections.
# this is where we specify our webmachine instances.
# in our case we start with just one instance, but
# we can add more later
frontend webfarm
  # listen on port 80 across all network interfaces
  bind *:80
  # by default, point at our backend configuration
  # which lists our webmachine instances (this is
  # configured below in another section)
  default_backend webmachines

# this section indicates how the connectivity to
# all the instances of webmachine should work.
# Again, for dev there is only one instance, but
# in production there would be more.
backend webmachines
  # we'll specify a round-robin configuration in
  # case we add nodes down the track.
  balance roundrobin
  # enable the "X-Forware-For" header so that
  # we can see the client's IP in Webmachine,
  # not just the proxy's address
  option forwardfor
  # later down the track we'll be making the use
  # of cookies for various reasons. So we'll
  # enable support for this while we're here.
  cookie SERVERID insert nocache indirect
  # list the servers who are to be balanced
  # (just the one in the case of dev)
  server Webmachine1 127.0.0.1:8000

########### Riak Configuration ###################

# We are yet to touch Riak so far, but given that
# this post is going to cover the basics of
# connectivity, we'll cover off the configuration
# now so we don't have to do it later.
frontend dbcluster
  # We'll be using protocol buffers to talk to
  # Riak, so we will change from the default mode
  # and use tcp instead
  mode tcp
  # we're only interested in allowing connections
  # from internal sources (so that we don't expose
  # ourselves to the web. so we shall only listen
  # on an internal interface on port 8080
  bind 127.0.0.1:8080
  # Default to the riak cluster configuration
  default_backend riaks

# Here is the magic bit which load balances across
# our three instances of riak which are clustered
# together
backend riaks
  # again, make sure we specify tcp instead of
  # the default http mode
  mode tcp
  # use a standard round robin approach for load
  # balancing
  balance roundrobin
  # list the three servers as optional targets
  # for load balancing - these are what we set
  # up during Part 1. Add health-checking as
  # well so that when nodes go down, HAProxy
  # can remove them from the cluster
  server Riak1 127.0.0.1:8081 check
  server Riak2 127.0.0.1:8082 check
  server Riak3 127.0.0.1:8083 check
