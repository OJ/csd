Code Smackdown (CSD)
====================

Code Smackdown is a sample application that demonstrates how web development can be done in [Erlang][] using [Webmachine][], [ErlyDTL][] and [Riak][]. The application is the source code that accompanies the [series of Erlang web development tutorials][series] available on [OJ's rants][blog].

The code is still in active development, as is the post series that accompanies it. It is not intended to be a definitive guide on how to build production-quality Erlang applications. The goal is to explore how things _might_ be done and to help people learn and get exposure to the nuances of developing applications with these tools.

Feel free to ping me via [@TheColonial][tc] if you have can comments or suggestions.
